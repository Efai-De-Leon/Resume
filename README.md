## Experience

---

### Personal Unity Project | C#

* Applied Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) SOLID principles to enhance code maintainability and extensibility.
* Integrated 3 design patterns (factory, observer, singleton) to reduce code coupling and improve debugging.
* Developed game mechanics, character controllers, and 3D graphics to craft straightforward games.

### SQL Databases Projects

* Crafted 40+ complex SQL queries for data extraction, filtering, and calculations.
* Constructed 5 databases that reflect the relationships between different attributes of complex data models.
* Experience with designing and developing databases in both Mysql Workbench and SQLite3 command line tools.

### Django Web Application Project | HTML/CSS, Python

* Collaborated with a team of 4 to develop a customized Django web application catering to the IoT-agriculture sector.
* Developed 4 web pages (landing, account creation, main board, and graphs) along with 6 live widgets for intuitive visualization of the incoming sensor data within a span of 6 months.
* Deployed and updated the application online for 4 months using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, ensuring continuous operation.

### CMOS Circuit Design Project

* Executed standard cell techniques to design and integrate NMOS/PMOS transistors into complex sequential logic circuits.
* Leveraged Cadence software to develop and assess 20+ electronic schematics such as multiplexers and counters.
* Designed and implemented a 4-bit full adder and subtractor with Cadence software using a standard cell approach with a runtime of 32us.

### Risc V CPU Design & Implementation Project | System Verilog

* Implemented a complete RISC-V CPU with a 5-step processing cycle and 6 distinct instructions in a team of 2.
* Programmed 2 advanced features into the CPU including pipelining and branch prediction providing improved performance and reducing pipeline stalling.
* Maintained documentation, reports, and detailed graphs to track and communicate the development process over 4 months.

### Lab Experience with Electronic Circuit Analysis

* Applied theoretical knowledge of electronics to practical applications by building real-world circuits in teams of 4+.
* Analyzed 20+ different circuits including Op-Amp, Filters, and RF with an oscilloscope and SPICE.
* Acquired hands-on experience with 25+ essential electronic components such as Diodes, Capacitors, Bipolar Junction, and Field-Effect Transistors.

### Chat Application Project | C

* Designed and programmed the Graphical User Interface for a Chat Application using the GTK library, encompassing contact lists, message interface, account creation, and pop-up windows within a 9-week deadline.
* Collaborated with a team of 4 on GitHub, coordinating code contributions, reviewing pull requests, and resolving merge conflicts to maintain a smooth and efficient development process.
* Established efficient team communication protocols using Discord with two dedicated channels (front-end and back-end), ensuring seamless collaboration and improving the development process.
